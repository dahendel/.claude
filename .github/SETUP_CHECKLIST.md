## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow not triggering:**
- Check workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`
- Verify YAML syntax is valid
- Check repository Actions settings are enabled

**Ruleset not working:**
- Verify ruleset enforcement is "Active"
- Check target branches include your branch
- Confirm you're testing with non-admin account
- Review bypass actors list (should be empty for strict enforcement)

**Status checks not required:**
- Go to ruleset settings
- Edit "Require status checks to pass" rule
- Add status checks by name (must match workflow job names)
- Save ruleset

**CODEOWNERS not working:**
- Check file is in `.github/CODEOWNERS`
- Verify usernames are correct (with @)
- Enable "Require review from Code Owners" in protection
